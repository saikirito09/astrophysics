# Stellar Evolution
- This is the process where the star changes over the course of time like lifetime and this leads on how the creation of new star happens as well.The life soan of the star is indirectionally proportional to the mass of the star.
- The stars are born from by the collapsing if the gas clouds of dust nd gas. We call it as nebula or molectuar clouds.
- The main sequence is more like the stable era for the star, its where the star have enough hydrogen like adult hood in humans. the star comes out of main sequence, when it have no hydrogen left right, then no fusion happens whcih causes it collapse
- The stages of the star formation -> main sequence -> post main sequence.
